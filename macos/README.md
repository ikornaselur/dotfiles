# My MacOS dotfiles

`bootstrap.sh` will bootstrap a fresh setup of MacOS, installing different tools and
apps that I use.

To run on a fresh install, open Terminal and run

```bash
curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ikornaselur/dotfiles/main/macos/bootstrap.sh | sh
```

Note.. I'm not expecting anyone else to use this, this is just a quick way for me to get up and running with a new machine
